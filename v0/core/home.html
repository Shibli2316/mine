    <div>
        it has the following functions
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>billing system</p>
        <p>Expense tracker</p>
        <p>makeing different tables in the backend and saving all the data of every byte in systematic order</p>
        <p>work flow</p>
        <p>discord integration to send files etc directly</p>
        <p>You Track integration/links for project tracking</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>We also have initial flow</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>initial data collection</li>
            <li>personal meeting -> see what is possible and how it can be done. Make inital questions</li>
            <li>first questionare rounfd</li>
            <li>personal meeting -> clarify everything and make a detailed idea about how things will work. Additional questions if needed</li>
            <li>clarification meeting with client we finalise project</li>
            <li>personal meeting -> finalise timeline and money</li>
            <li>money and timeline final with the client with the first prototype (last chances to make changes for free and sign the doc)</li>
            <li>peronal meeting -> finalise everything</li>
            <li>present the first final prototype and start the actual work</li>
            <li>personal meeting -> dividing work and shifting to you track</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>All the meetings we will have should be documented using AI. we need the MOMs of every meeting. Also after every meeting it should be sent to the discord and everytime a new project comes up it should make a new channel with the byte name and organise accordingly.</h3>
        <p>Also in step 6 when we finalise money it should be according to the billing system and it should give us an template. We can negotiate but there should be some minimum criteria below which we will not go. Exceptions may be entertained. This doc will also be sent to the dicord with a voting message if everyone aggres to it then it will be saved in the database else we can have a reevaluation meeting</p>
        <p>After the breakdown of thw work we shift to you track for all the project management. it has all the tracking tool includnig time and project load etc. it will be integrated with git and through git we will integrate CI/CD pipeline to make the integration of main code base easy. <strong> ONE WILL MAKE THE CHANGES IN THE PORODUCTION SERVER </strong> no matter how small the change is. It should be first made in the local environment and then staged into git and then pushed into production code</p>
        <p>other rules and protypes will also be mentioned in the core team dashboard</p>
        <p>It may also have social media integration to track advertisement and other things</p>
